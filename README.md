This project runs Vite in two configurations.

`vite.config.js` is a standard Vite configuration that builds the frontend preview app from `index.html`

`vite.config.js` is a "library mode" configuration from the `src/lib/index.js` entrypoint which outputs:

- `/build/lib/index.js`
- `/build/lib/style.css`
